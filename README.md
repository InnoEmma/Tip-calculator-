🍕🔥 The Great Domino's Pepper Soup Incident
📅 Last Tuesday at Domino's, Lekki...
My guy Chidi and I pulled up for the legendary "Two‑for‑Tuesday" pizza deal. Here's what we ordered:

🍕 2 Large Pepperoni Pizzas (~₦9,350 each) – ₦18,700

🍗 Extra Suya Chicken Wings – ₦3,000 (starting from₦3 000)

🧾 Total bill: ₦22,265

Service was 💯 — the waiter even brought free pepper soup!

Chidi got emotional (said it tasted like his grandma's 😭), so he tapped 20% tip.
Me? I remembered last week's NEPA bill and tapped 10%.

📱 The app averaged it out: 15% tip = ₦3,340

But then...

🧨 Chaos Begins
When Chidi saw:
👉 TOTAL: ₦25,605

He jumped up yelling:

“₦25k?! Omo! This waiter wan buy iPhone 15!” 📱💥

What happened next:
🏃‍♂️ The manager ran in thinking we were fighting

🤯 Chidi mistook TOTAL for just the TIP

😱 He spilled pepper soup on his white agbada

🤬 Started arguing in pidgin: “Why you dey do like Lagos politician?”

🤝 Resolution
✅ We showed the app breakdown (manager was impressed)

🧘 The waiter picked extra ₦500 for “emotional stress”

🍩 We got free puff‑puff for customer education

🧠 Moral of the Story
Never let your Benin friend calculate tips during a pepper soup emotional moment 😅.
Thank God for the app — it saved us from turning Domino’s into WWE Smackdown! 🥴
