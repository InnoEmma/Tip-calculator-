## 🧑‍🍳 Service & Tip Drama

The service was 💯 — the waiter even brought **free pepper soup**!

- Chidi got emotional (said it tasted like his grandma's 😭), so he tipped **20%**.
- I remembered my **NEPA bill**, so I tipped **10%**.

**App average tip: 15% = ₦3,340**

---

## 🧨 Chaos Begins

Chidi saw this on the app:

> 👉 **TOTAL: ₦25,605**

And yelled:

> **“₦25k?! Omo! This waiter wan buy iPhone 15!”** 📱💥

## 🥴 What Happened Next

- 🏃‍♂️ Manager ran in thinking we were fighting  
- 🤯 Chidi thought TOTAL was just the TIP  
- 😱 Pepper soup spilled on white agbada  
- 🤬 Arguing in pidgin: “Why you dey do like Lagos politician?”

---

## 🤝 Resolution

- ✅ Showed the app breakdown (manager was impressed)  
- 🧘 Waiter got extra **₦500** for *“emotional stress”*  
- 🍩 Got free **puff‑puff** for customer education

## 🧠 Moral of the Story

> **Never let your Benin friend calculate tips during a pepper soup emotional moment.** 😅  
> Thank God for the app — it saved us from turning Domino’s into WWE Smackdown! 🥴
